# Login-Interface
Prompts user for username and password and validates if input is correct. 

Creates a UI and prompts user to enter 'username' and 'password'. User can click sign in to check if username and password are a valid login combnation(referenceing the excel sheet storing all username and passwords). When the user enters the password, the UI displays '*'s instead of the actual characters the user entered. The characters which the user entered are still stored. Additionally, the user can click sign up. This action is to create a user profile wiht teh entered username and password. The login info is then stored so that it can be used later. 

TODO: 
- Create a peek ability to check what was entered for the password(Showing the characters of the password instead of ***).
- Create forgot log in ability
- Create interface for the user to create a profile including name, email, ect.
